# This section defines the trigger for the workflow.
# In this case, it runs on every 'push' to the 'main' branch.

  # We have a single job named 'build-and-push'

    # The job will run on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # These are the sequential steps that the job will execute
    steps:
      # --- CI (Continuous Integration) Steps ---

      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code so the job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment (optional but good practice for testing)
      # This step isn't strictly needed for just building a Docker image,
      # but it's essential if you want to run 'npm test' or other Node scripts.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4

        run: |
          npm install
          echo "No tests to run for this example, but they would go here."
          # npm test # You would uncomment this line in a real project

      # --- CD (Continuous Deployment) Steps ---

      # Step 4: Set up Docker Buildx for more advanced build features
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx

      # Step 5: Log in to Docker Hub using the secrets we created earlier
